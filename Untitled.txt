Key Features for the Business Model
1. Financing Model:
Page 15 of 17
◦ Loan Options: Offer flexible loan terms (short-term, long-term) with 
competitive interest rates specifically for 1-bedroom apartments 
intended for AirBnB hosting.
◦ Revenue Sharing: Alternatively, you could explore a revenue-sharing 
model where TOBI funds a percentage of the property and earns a 
share of the rental income.
2. Eligibility and Application Process:
◦ Define criteria such as creditworthiness, estimated ROI (based on 
location and demand), and proof of intent for AirBnB use.
◦ Create clear terms for repayment, loan tenure, and penalties.
3. Property Selection:
◦ Partner with developers and real estate agents to curate a list of 
properties specifically suited for AirBnB hosting. These could be 
highlighted on the dashboard.
4. Risk Mitigation:
◦ Use predictive tools or analytics to assess the viability of an investment 
(e.g., location-based AirBnB income potential, seasonal demand).
◦ Ensure legal compliance and appropriate insurance coverage for 
properties.
Dashboard Features
To make the user experience seamless, the dashboard should include the following 
sections:
1. Search and Explore Properties:
◦ Allow users to browse pre-vetted one-bedroom apartments by 
location, price, and estimated AirBnB income potential.
2. Financing Application Portal:
◦ Include an easy-to-follow loan application process with clear steps and 
requirements.
◦ Users should be able to upload documents like ID, proof of income, 
credit history, and AirBnB business plans.
3. Investment Calculator:
◦ Add a tool that calculates expected returns, loan repayment timelines, 
and profit margins to help users make informed decisions.
4. Progress Tracking:
◦ Show the status of their financing application (e.g., submitted, under 
review, approved).
◦ Highlight the steps to finalize the deal.
5. Knowledge Hub:
◦ Include resources such as guides on how to run a successful AirBnB, tax 
implications, and property maintenance tips.
6. Integration with AirBnB:
◦ Allow users to integrate their AirBnB accounts post-purchase to monitor 
performance and revenues directly from the dashboard.
Implementation Steps
1. Market Research:
◦ Study your target market to understand demand for AirBnB financing. 
Focus on areas with high short-term rental demand and legal 
frameworks supporting such investments.
Page 16 of 17
2. Build Partnerships:
◦ Collaborate with banks, real estate developers, and property 
management firms to provide a comprehensive package.
3. Develop the Dashboard:
◦ Utilize tools like React for a sleek front-end and integrate APIs for 
property listings, loan processing, and revenue analytics.
◦ Ensure data security and compliance with financial regulations.
4. Pilot Program:
◦ Start with a specific city or region as a test market to refine the model 
and gather feedback.
5. Marketing Strategy:
◦ Leverage social media, real estate events, and AirBnB host 
communities to attract users.
Overall Thoughts
This idea has strong potential as it caters to the growing AirBnB economy and 
offers a streamlined way for investors to enter the market. Combining property 
search, financing, and education in one platform can make TOBI a one-stop shop 
for AirBnB investors. However, it will be crucial to address risks like loan defaults, 
property mismanagement, and fluctuating rental markets through careful 
planning and robust due diligence.
